abstract="We describe a formalization of the elementary algebra, topology and analysis of finite-dimensional Euclidean space in the HOL Light theorem prover. (Euclidean space is {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb R{\}}^{\{}N{\}}{\$}with the usual notion of distance.) A notable feature is that the HOL type system is used to encode the dimension N in a simple and useful way, even though HOL does not permit dependent types. In the resulting theory the HOL type system, far from getting in the way, naturally imposes the correct dimensional constraints, e.g. checking compatibility in matrix multiplication. Among the interesting later developments of the theory are a partial decision procedure for the theory of vector spaces (based on a more general algorithm due to Solovay) and a formal proof of various classic theorems of topology and analysis for arbitrary N-dimensional Euclidean space, e.g. Brouwer's fixpoint theorem and the differentiability of inverse functions.",

Earlier work on the Isabelle Quotient package has yielded great progress in automation, but it still has many technical limitations.",

abstract="We investigate how projective plane geometry can be formalized in a proof assistant such as Coq. Such a formalization increases the reliability of textbook proofs whose details and particular cases are often overlooked and left to the reader as exercises. Projective plane geometry is described through two different axiom systems which are formally proved equivalent. Usual properties such as decidability of equality of points (and lines) are then proved in a constructive way. The duality principle as well as formal models of projective plane geometry are then studied and implemented in Coq. Finally, we formally prove in Coq that Desargues' property is independent of the axioms of projective plane geometry.",
